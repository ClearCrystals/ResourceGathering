By Grace Steinmetz

### Build Version
- 2021.3.22f1

### Gameplay
Click on Resouces to bring them back to your magical chest to make as much money as possible. 

#### Goal in making the game
The goal of this game is to have young kids understand within an envirnoment the scarcity of resouces. 

#### How the mechanics align with this goal
Mechanics that are used are Sprites automatically moving, user being able to click on objects, and the Gold Counter.

#### What this game can do
- User clicks on resouce
- Sprite automatically will move to that resouce until resouce depletes or user clicks on another resouce.
- Gold Counter goes up for every sucessful mine. 

#### Improvments
If I had more time and could expand on this game I would...
- Have more sprites and switch camera between sprites.
- Have more chests to assign more sprites to chests. 
- More different types of resouces with their own counter.
- Have enimies spawn and have to balence multiple resouces with negitive effects if a resouce runs out. 
- With the goal of creating the bigggest surviving population.
